Problem 3: For Loops
While there are two main types of loops, while-loops and for-loops, for this problem, we will 
be working with for-loops. The range() funtion is a common function used to set the number of 
iterations the loop will run for. 
Using a for loop, give the sum for a(sub n) = a (sub n-1) + 5 
where the first term is 1 and n = 100. The answer should be 5346.


Problem 4: Writing and Calling Functions
Write a divide(a, b) function that takes two parameters and then call it to divide:
a) 10 / 2
b) 57 / 0
c) 26 / -4
Recall that functions start with "def" and end with a return statement.


Problem 5: Lists
Lists have a set order which means the different elements in a given list can be accessed by its index 
(eg. listName[0] is the first element of a list). Lists can also be manipulated by various list-related functions
that you can see using dir(list). Set sampleList[] to the value [0,1,2,3,4,5]. Using the list functions, 
change the even numbers to the string version of the number (ie. 2 is two) and change the range from 0-5 to 1-8.


Problem 6: Scopes
Scopes are different planes of your programming workspace. You will use and change scopes when you use: 
import, (nested) loops, functions, if/else statements
Using your divide() function from Problem 4, execute:
x = 0
for i in range(5):
  x = i
  y = 4*x / x**2        #this is where you use your function

In how many scopes was x used? How many times did the program change scope?
answers: 3, 12


Problem 7: Dictionaries
Using the list you created in Problem 5, make a dictionary that maps "odd" to the odd numbers and 
"even" to the even numbers (eg. {1 : 'odd', 'two' : 'even'}.
