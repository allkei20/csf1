Programming Homework-Replacement Proposal



1) virtually simulate drawing a hand in Magic the Gathering
2) using raw_input(), promt the "player" is s/he would like to draw another hand,
   keep, play a card, attack, or pass turn
3) the program will keep track of the game as players play an actual game (ie. life totals, 
   what cards are on the table, etc.)
