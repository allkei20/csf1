Programming Homework-Replacement Proposal



1) use the keyboard as raw-input to turn it into a synth keyboard to play 8-bit sounds
2) in a text input, be able to type "super mario" or "tetris" etc. to play the 8-bit 
   theme music from a few games and then be able to switch to the keyboard input to be 
   able to "jam" over the theme music.
3) maybe turn it into a typing version of DDR where the keys that make the sound for 
   a theme song are displayed so you can actually play the song yourself
