Homework 3 

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.3

Problem 3:

When seq and linenum are removed, the next time either is called, the program won't know what it is and will return an error. I predict the same thing will happen with gc_count when its initialization to zero is commented out... As it turns out, that's exactly what is returned: a “not defined” error.

Problem 4:

GC-content: 0.5994
AT-content: 1.0
G count: 12176
C count: 11800
A count: 7970
T count: 32030

Collaboration:

keir helped me out when all my outputs were 0.0

Reflection:

I would've liked problem 4 to be “change the program to have it spit out the desired answer from problem 1” instead of splitting it up in two parts


Problem 6:

AT-content, T count, and the ratio are almost always off but close. The sum is hit and miss.

No collaborators.
